This repository contains config files for my favourite tools:

  - managed by [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/)
- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
  - including [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

I'm also using Emacs with the [Prelude](http://batsov.com/prelude/) distribution.
