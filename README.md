This repository contains config files for my favourite tools:

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
  - managed by [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
  - including [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [Tarsnap](https://www.tarsnap.com/)

I'm also using Emacs with the [Prelude](http://batsov.com/prelude/) distribution.
You can find my fork at https://github.com/JanAhrens/prelude.
